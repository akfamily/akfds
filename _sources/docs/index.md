# 开源财经数据科学书籍

这是一本关于财经数据科学知识的开源书籍，作者是 [Albert King](https://www.akshare.xyz/) and [John
Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/).

```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
```


These lectures are a mini-version of a [longer
series](https://executablebooks.github.io/quantecon-example/docs/index.html)
of lectures, also built using Jupyter Book 2.0.  That series contains more
features and applications but also requires more libraries and takes longer to
run.  

Both lecture series are taken from a [more complete set of
lectures](https://python.quantecon.org) on open source computing hosted by
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org).
